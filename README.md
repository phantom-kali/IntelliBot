# IntelliBot

IntelliBot is a customizable chatbot framework designed to handle natural language understanding (NLU) and dialogue management tasks efficiently. This project leverages libraries such as spaCy, scikit-learn, and Word2Vec to create a robust conversational agent capable of handling various intents and providing relevant responses.

## Features

- **Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**: Identifies user intents and extracts entities using spaCy and scikit-learn.
- **Dialogue Management**: Generates contextually appropriate responses based on user intents.
- **Action Execution**: Executes predefined actions based on user inputs.
- **Configurable Responses**: Easily modify responses through a YAML configuration file.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/phantom-kali/IntelliBot.git
